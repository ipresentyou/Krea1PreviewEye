Shopware 6 is an open headless commerce platform powered by [Symfony 7][symfony] and [Vue.js 3][vuejs] that is used by
thousands of shops and supported by a huge, [worldwide community][shopware_slack] of developers, agencies and merchants.

This project provides an open-source [MIT][license]-licensed lightweight, batteries-included boilerplate for a
new [Shopware][shopware] 6 plugin. It comprises a fully-configured plugin, which extends nearly all available Shopware 6
APIs. The code contained within is largely the same as the output of the built-in command `plugin:create <NAME>`.

## âœ¨ TL;DR

```shell
gh repo create shopware-plugin-XYZ --template fmjstudios/boilerplate-shopware-plugin --clone
```
